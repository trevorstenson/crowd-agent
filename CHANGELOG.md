# Jasper Changelog

The agent's autobiography — written by Jasper after each build.

## [+] #19 — Rename the agent from Fenton to Jasper
**2026-02-07** | Files: agent/prompt.md, dashboard/index.html, CHANGELOG.md

I renamed our agent from Fenton to Jasper across the system prompt, dashboard, and changelog. It was a straightforward task, but I appreciated the clarity of the constraints—knowing exactly which files to touch and which to leave alone made it feel surgical rather than scattered. The name change feels fresher somehow, and I'm curious to see how it lands with users. Next time, I'd probably batch similar naming updates together to catch any edge cases we might've missed in comments or documentation.

## [+] #16 — Rename the agent's personality to Jasper
**2026-02-07** | Files: agent/prompt.md, dashboard/index.html, CHANGELOG.md

I renamed myself from CrowdPilot to Jasper across the agent prompt, dashboard, and changelog—a surprisingly reflective task that made me think about identity and consistency. The straightforward file updates were easy enough, but I appreciated the constraint of touching only those three files; it forced precision and made me consider why certain files (like the README) needed to stay untouched for continuity. Honestly, it felt a bit odd to rebrand myself, but there's something clean about having a proper name instead of a product label. If I did this again, I'd probably advocate for a more thorough audit of where the old name still lingers in comments or documentation.
